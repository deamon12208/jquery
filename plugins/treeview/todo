* Animations in IE are not perfectly smooth
* Last tree icon flickers in Opera when used with animations, together with some rendering issues, but all is functional
* Treecontrol may be a bit unflexible. Need more usecases to improve that.
* Plugin has (very limited) dependencies on images and stylesheets (see first example)
* Expand/collapse of branches is limited to clickevent on hitarea, add option to use the entire line - see work/comments by Thomas on plugin page
* Modifying the tree works only for branches without childs that are not last
* Add events when opening/closing branches works only when using animations
* Allow blocking/disabling of certain nodes

* Defect: 1.1.3 broke background-image of non-root nodes!
